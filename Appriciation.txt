Hi Anandh, Good Day!

I want to take a moment to acknowledge your exceptional contributions since you joined our team. 
Your quick grasp of requirements is truly impressive, and your assistance with clarifying automation scripts for other team members has been invaluable.

One notable point is that your scripts have demonstrated a higher success rate in execution. They are well-designed and followed a meticulous approach, which is fantastic. 
Your willingness to work beyond office hours to run and troubleshoot scripts is greatly appreciated.

Your ability to anticipate potential issues is impressive, and your adherence to 'Proper Selenium-Java' standards reflects a deep understanding of the challenges.
Despite having less than 2 years of experience, if you maintain this high level of code quality, you have the potential to become a â€˜Fullstack Automation Architectâ€™.
I have also heard from the manual QA team about how you have frequently assisted them with their automation queries.

You put in tremendous effort to restructure the Sales module scripts, which were initially automated by Rajeswari but not done correctly. 
You seized the opportunity to re-script them properly. Great job, Anandh!

KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK ðŸ˜Š

Note: One piece of feedback is to consider sharing your accomplishments more widely in forums and project discussions. While you're proactively showcasing your work will help others learn from your experience.

Thank you,
S. Ramesh
