//ETL(Extract/Transform/Load) Tools and BI(Bussiness Intelligence) Tools

//ETL Tool:

Informatica Power Center (Dev & Test)
Query Surge (testing Tool)
MS MSSQLSERVER SSIS (ETL Testing) 


//Bussiness Intelligence Tools :

Bussiness Objects
Cognos
Tableau
Quickview


What is ETL?

ETL stands for Extract/Transform/Load. it is the process of How data loaded from source System to the data warehouse 

//Types of Data Load :

1)Full Load(Bulk Load) : Data Loading at First Time (Fresh Data)
2)Incremental Load (Refresh Load) : Modified Data

//Data Cleansing or Data Scrubbring

Removing Irrelevant and Redudent data. Correcting Incorrect and Incomplete data.

Irrelevent : Deleting Data Which are not Required.
Redudent : Deleting Duplicate Data
Incorrect : Updating incorrect values with correct values
Incomplete : Updating incomplete values with correct values

//Data Masking : Secure the Data

Hiding/Encrypting the Sensitive Data

Data Masking Techniques :

Replacing subset data with dummy Charecters(ex:aaa)
Replacing subset data with dummy Numbers(ex:111)
Replacing subset data with dummy Random numbers(ex:1678)
Replacing subset data with dummy Special Charecters(ex:xxx)
Replacing subset data with dummy Shuffling Charecters and Numbers

//ODS (Operational Data Source) :

Integrated Data from different bussiness Sources
Get the data from Transational Database
Limited period of History data (30 to 90 days)

//Staging Area :
intermediate storage area used for data processing for Extract,Transform and load

//Data Warehouse :

Data Warehouse is also known as EDW(Enterprise data warehouse) used for reporting and data analysis and core component of bussiness unit
DWs are central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate sources

//Data Mart :

Data Mart is the subset of Data warehouse and specific bussiness Line or team

//Data Retention - Archiving or Purging

Data Retention is how the data need to be available in the database (or) Deleting the historical data

//why Data Retention Policy required :
performance impact
Cost high
Old Record may not be useful

Purging : Deleting data from database crosses the defined retentiontime
Archiving : Moving data to another database


//ETL Testing Life Cycle/Process :

1.Requirement Analysis
2.Test Planning
3.Test Design
4.Test Execution
5.Defect Retesting
6.Test Closure/Sign off

1.Requirement Analysis : 
Required for 
Data Model(how many tables,what kind of data table contain,What are the Relationship b/w tables) 
Mapping Documents(What are the sources and Target and Transformation technique to apply)

2.Test Planning :(How to test,What to test, When to test)

3.Test Design : (Data type, Data Length, Relationship)

4.Test Execution : Executing the test cases

5.Defect Retesting : Fix the defect, Impact analysis

6.Sign off : Push the Code to next level 


//ETL Scenarios :

Table Structure Verification : Column Name, data Type,data length of the target table
Constraint Check : All the Constraint available
Index check : index created with required columns
Source Data validation  : Record source table count
Data Count Check : Comparing target data count against source data count along with the major filter or Joining Condition
Data Comparison Check : Source data Correctly moved to the Target table
Duplicate Data Validation : Dplicate record will be rejected
Data with primarykey and foreign key check : Different test data for parent and child table
Null check : Null and NotNull column and verify the data will be rejected
Data Precision check : Source table with different pression and loaded data has different pression
All business transformation rules validation : TSD(Transformation Specification Document) needs to be tested keep separate testcases for every transformation

//Transformation :

Active Transformation : The output record count may or may not equal to input record count eg:Filter Transformation based on the age limit 25 to 40
Passive Transformation : The output record count is equal to input record count eg:expression transformation concatenate firstname and Lastname


//Types of Transformation :

Filter Transformation (Active)
Expression Transformation (Active)
Aggeregator Transformation (Active)
Joiner Transformation (Active)
Union Transformation (Active)
Sorter Transformation (Passive)
Rank Transformation (Passive)
