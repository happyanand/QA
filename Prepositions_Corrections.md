Subject: Update **-for** +**on** Implementation of CRM Module

Hi Team,

Hope you are doing well. I’m writing to provide +**an** update about the CRM implementation scheduled to next week. As discussed -**for** our previous meeting, the team has been working on the configuration of the module and it is now ready to be deployed **into** production.

However, there are few minor dependencies still pending. One of the main items is related +**to** the data migration from **a** legacy system. We are currently coordinating with data team to **-an** ensure all records are validated before **go** live.

Please **-an** ensure that all test cases are re-executed by the end of the week and any issues are reported **to** me immediately. Also, note that we will be having a dry-run -**over** this Friday to simulate the deployment process.

**Meanwhile,** I request you to review the user training material shared in the Teams folder and suggest if any changes are needed.

Let me know if you have any concerns or require any additional support in **this** regards.

Regards,

Meera Pillai
